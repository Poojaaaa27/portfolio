Pooja J - AI Innovator | Creative Technologist | Real-World Problem Solver
Final-year B.Tech student at SRM University, passionate about applying AI and ML to solve real-world challenges. Proven experience in research, hackathons, and impactful projects.

About Me:
From my first "Hello, World!" program to developing complex machine learning models, my passion for technology has been a journey of constant learning and creation. As a final-year Computer Science student specializing in AI, I'm driven by the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant, impactful solutions. Whether it's through research, building full-stack applications, or competing in hackathons, I thrive on pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code. My goal is to leverage technology to build a smarter, more efficient future.
Fun Fact: When I'm not coding, I'm an avid keyboardist! I love recreating symphony pieces and exploring new melodiesâ€”it's my own version of algorithmic composition.
